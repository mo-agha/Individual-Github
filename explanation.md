For the first feature, the inputs for the integer array are randomly generated through a Math.random function. 
The sorting method is called on the randomized unsorted array, and the output is a sorted array.
The test runs a loop to check if the numbers are sorted properly throughtout the array, and prints true or false depending on the result (true after the sort).

The second feature takes an array of unsorted words as inputs. 
The simple sorting method is called on the unsorted array of strings, and a sorted array is printed as output.
The test also runs a loop to compare strings in the sorted array, making sure they are properly sorted, and also printing true or false depending on the result.

Both tests worked and both showed the correct true or false response when testing with sorted and unsorted arrays. 
(There were a few times where it bugged and showed the wrong output, i.e. false instead of true, but for the majority of runs it worked properly).
