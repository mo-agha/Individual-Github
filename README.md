# Individual-Github

The first feature includes a simple method that takes the imported Arrays class and uses 'Arrays.sort' to sort a randomized integer array.
The main method runs a test by creating a random array, applying the sorting method, then checking if the array is sorted properly. 
The feature can be used by running it on any unsorted array to get the sorted array.
